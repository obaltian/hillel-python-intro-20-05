# Plan
1. Homework review 
2. Conditional operators
    1. If (talk about identation blocks, pep8, namespaces)
    2. Else
    3. Elif (talk about rationale - avoid nesting)
    4. Ternary operator (example in C, rationale)
    5. LBYL (spoiler EAFP)
3. Loop operators
    1. While loop
        1. Remember to update condition to avoid infinite loop
        2. Iteration term
    2. For loop
        1. Iterable object
        2. With variable or _
    3. Break
    4. Continue
    5. Else
    6. Optional - iter, next
