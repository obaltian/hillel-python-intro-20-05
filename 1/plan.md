# Plan
1. Introduction from school
2. Introduction to programming and Python
    1. What is
    2. Python history
    3. Where used
    4. Pros (simplicity, community (PEP), development speed and readability)
    6. Cons (performance)
    7. What is programming language
    8. Kinds of programming languages
        1. Compiled
        2. Interpreted
3. Basic software
    1. Python installation
    2. How to run Python
        1. Python REPL
        2. Python scripts
    3. PyCharm installation
4. Introduction to Python
    1. print & input
    2. Introduction to types
        1. Python typing
            1. Dynamically typed
                - values have type, not variables
                - variables are references to values
            2. Strong typed
                1. Weak typing - JS
                2. Strict typing - Haskell (Python can do 1 + 0.1)
        2. Types - int, float, str
            1. int
            2. float
            3. str
