0. Tests and assertions
1. Files
    1. What is a file?
        1. Header (filename, size, etc)
        2. Content (text, binary)
        3. EOF (end of file)
    4. EOL - \r\n vs \n
    2. Opening a file
        1. Modes - r/w/x/a b/t +
        2. Operations
        3. Always close the file
2. Context managers
    1. Rationale - RAII
    2. `with` statement as replacement for `try/finally`
3. Decorators - probably next lesson
